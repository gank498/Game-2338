## Summary
//Gauntlet Dark Legacy is a top-down dungeon crawler hack and slash style game that has a few unique characteristics compared to most this is the 6th released title of the series but more known than the other due to it being on console most were arcade games back when arcades were very popular. But then the home console started to take over that market and they decided to release it on all current consoles at this time including Nintendo's handheld game boy advance.

//The game was developed by Midway games most people know that as Atari they renamed there brand to avoid confusion between the two atari brands after the release of san Francisco Rush 2049. In the year 2000 it was first released for the arcade then PlayStation 2 in 2001 and all other consols in 2002. It takes place in a fantasy world where an evil mage named Garm uses the power of something called Runestones and the players goals is to go into each realm and recover them from his generals which are gods of Norse mythology which is already uncommon for games as most are focused on greek mythology which makes the story more unique not everyone knows Norse mythology.

// you're able to choose 4 different classes each class gender depends on the title for example wizard is male and sorceress is female your able to choose color which also chooses your type of magic as well as your style of clothes your able to change class at any point in the game but new class will be level 1 but other classes you leveled before will remain to switch at anytime  controls are very simple but the one thing that stood out in this game is the ability to combine class ability with friends this game does have local multiplayer up to 4 friends each class has a special meter when it's full your able to use it for your personal ability or you can combine it with your ally and make a stronger ability making class synergy and decision more strategic with your team.

//playing this game between PlayStation 2 GameCube and arcade the ports are simple and easy to adjust the controls cross over well PlayStation 2 has a higher boost in textures so they did get visual upgrade in some cases some oversights in the game is your ability to clip into other player and get stuck and sometimes monster spawn in a wall and you cant continue must restart the level the puzzles are challenging and unlocking other characters is hard but rewarding difficulty does scale with more player keeping the challenge more competitive they also added mini-games like tag or a race with players on top of the level objective which makes it fun.
  

## Final Thoughts

Overall this games has a lot of great features and things to enjoy they only thing I would want to see change is a better UI for setting menu it can get laggy when your in the menu cause of the visual effect of the menu it's nice but not at the cost of functionality also the wording could have been done better some things are very vague like items you pick up there no subtitle for the narrator so if you can hear over the battle you miss information which can cause confusion.
