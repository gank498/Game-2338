Red Dead Redemption 2

Game has great graphics and great scenery no noticable clipping of textures. Looks as the game claims to be western/midwestern colors give the vibe of the olden days which is nice most games over saturate there colors.Gameplay is solid feels as you expect from a triple A game and a big company as rock star fighting is fun horse chases and trains feel like the real deal good immersion.

  As for quality not very optimized on PC glitches and buggy on console its little less buggy but the bugs are there few can out right crash the game but ways around it there. Thier updates are a bit slow when the game first launched on pc the games didn't run on any modern cpu without doing a lot of hackery things to fix it which not many people are willing to do when paying 60 USD on a game took about a month before those bugs were fixed and a patch was realised. on console they did now have these issue which tells me the ported it without doing much testing so this game did not meet most of the software quality factors when it launched 4 months late it is now playable and works great on pc with a lot of minor bugs so as of today yes it meets software quality factors.
