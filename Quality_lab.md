--------------------------------------------Red Dead Redemption 2----------------------------------------------------------------

Red Dead Redeption 2 by rockstar games is the 2nd installement of the series.The Game has great graphics and great scenery no noticable clipping of textures. Looks as the game claims to be western/midwestern colors give the vibe of the olden days which is nice most games over saturate there colors.Gameplay is solid feels as you expect from a triple A game and a big company as rock star fighting is fun horse chases and trains feel like the real deal good immersion.

  As for quality not very optimized on PC glitches and buggy on console its little less buggy but the bugs are there few can out right crash the game but ways around it there. Thier updates are a bit slow when the game first launched on pc the games didn't run on any modern cpu without doing a lot of hackery things to fix it which not many people are willing to do when paying 60 USD on a game took about a month before those bugs were fixed and a patch was realised. on console they did now have these issue which tells me the ported it without doing much testing so this game did not meet most of the software quality factors when it launched 4 months late it is now playable and works great on pc with a lot of minor bugs so as of today yes it meets software quality factors.
-----------------------------------------------------Left4Dead2--------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Zombie game right? well not exactly Left4Dead2 brought some unique mechanics other zombies games didn't have that made this game stand out from the competition when games like call of duty blacks ops was out and held its own its a 4 player co-op story based game with an end goal with a lot of different zombie types you can do the game run and gun or even stealth with voice actors with dialog to each other made the game feel more alive each character has their own ability and load outs unlike most survival zombie games out at this time they also have a mêlée weapon system that forces you to get close to them not just shoot making a more strategy oriented with your team friendly fire was always on with ether stun or damage making it more team based.
  The creators of this game is Valve a major game company in the PC space which lead to the development of a Steam  Workshop which allows mods from the community making the game more customizable for your experience game was released in 2009 for windows and Xbox 360.Their game was really well made from a developer stand point the bugs where very minimal for a dame in this era when steam early access games became a thing a lot of developers had to do a rush job. But valve ended up making a solid game with no major game breaking bugs as for controller support it was a nightmare if you didnt know much about programing you had to read a lot of tutorials cause the game had a open-source command engine that allows you to code your own scripts for controllers and even split-screen with 2 controllers.
--------------------------------------------Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood----------------------------------------------------------
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a spin-off game of the orignal games that was made by ubisoft using the unity engine because the game was reusing the same engine as Assassin's Creed 3 one of there top games it didn't require much changing to make a whole new game that wouldn't feel to far off for fan's who have played the series but offers a few new elements adding more puzzles. This game had bad implementation on PC due to the mechanic for pressure sensitivity which you cannon get with a keyboard key so many players had to switch to using a controller on pc.
  When the game launched it had a rough start with Voice de-Synching or no sound at all also few issues with players getting save stuck in a death loop causing players to restart the game from the beginning  this was a major issue the company could not fix for a month after release.After a year past the game was better less buggy and more playable but in this time players lost interest as ubisoft released another game called Assassin's Creed: Revelation.They maintained the game pretty well for the year it was on all major consoles and could run on almost any pc of its era making it very optimized controls transferred well except for keyboard and mouse which may be a deal breaker for players who hate controllers overall the game was successful and ubisoft made profit off this game
