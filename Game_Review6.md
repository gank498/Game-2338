### Rating

4 out of a 5 star

## Summary

--Grandia II is a JRPG with a unique turn-based system that allows the player to place their players in specific spots around the battlefield to allow more strategic fighting style as some monster mechanics can be caused by directions of where they face. in mid-battle you allow to change equipment to prepare for different aspects the game is fairly old and yet it has Awsomre pre-animated cut scenes that you would never see in this era even voice acting was in the game both in Japanese and English.

 --the game first released in 2000 and 2001 on the Dreamcast and then in 2002 if moves to PlayStation 2 and pc and then in 2019 remastered on Nintendo switch and have played PlayStation 2 pc and switch ports the game felt like it always has the game controls just crossed well and allowed old players to return without having to relearn but if you never played the game before there is no tutorial level and throws the player straight in cause back then games came with guide books and how to play book so if you buy it on current-gen hardware it make take a bit learning curve.
 
 --the game was created by game arts a Japanese company with connections with major companies like square Enix and Bandi and even sony entertainment and this is how they marketed it across multiple platforms. the game's story is well interesting taking place in a fantasy world with a hard religious standpoint and political world the game is. the only issue with this game is the slowdowns in some parts of the game it slows down to almost a halt or if there is to much magic on screen the game slows down bad

## Final Thoughts

--The game overall is fantastic the major improvements are constant sounds effect will loop like fire or footsteps the sounds will loop and you can hear the loop music of the game is great but sound effects are bad and the game optimization when too many particle effects can cause major issues but other than that this game stands out as one of a kinda must play the game I highly recommend this to someone who wants something different to experience
