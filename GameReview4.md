## Summary

--No mans sky was a popular title when it launched but not for good reason it was released Aug 2016 and was advertised as a infinite possibility game and promised multiplayer with friends but the game was so big running into another player would be impossible but that didn't last long as 2 players found the same planet and went to the same spot and yet couldn't see or interact with each other cause the game was not multiplayer like the developers promised.
--This caused a huge stir in the gaming community and almost put the company under Hello Games was released on all consoles the game was pretty solid and was fun but got very repetitive and boring there was not a lot of wildlife on the planets or different planets making the game feel dead and empty fast forward a few years later they released the synthesis which created real way to interact with your friends and others player but did not come without cost the bugs are tremendous like land that someone broke down coming back on other players screen making them float or fall under the world forcing player bases out of the ground even event not spawning on other players screen making it hard to work together
--Since launch, they have added many things such as building crafting learning perks and upgrading ships as well as online events with player that can unlock cosmetics they even added a character customization allow you to stand out from other players Hello games did a terrible launching the game but are great at updating and releasing free expansions theirs also no microtransactions in this day in age its rear but it also makes it stand out from a cash grab. Ship battles are fun and immersive and make you feel like a real starship battle and you're able to partner up with up to 4 friends. You can upgrade and power up your ship this is how you get around from universe to universe planet to planet the game revolves around your ship cause it would take days in real-time to get anywhere without it.
--I would say now in 2020 after all the updates and patches this games is defiantly worth checking out I would not have recommended this in 2016 but now I can say its a good game and great time killer the graphics looks fantastic the possibilities are endless it does get repetitive but if you find 3 friends it makes the game a lot more enjoyable

## Final Thoughts

in 2016 I would have advised not to buy it find something else but in 2020 I recommend checking it out it's still getting loads of updates and content and a growing community it's a great game to kill time has a great soundtrack i would like to see more than just your 4 companions in the universe but other than that the game environment does feel alive and draws you into exploring
