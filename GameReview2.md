## Summary

--Dungeon Defenders a tower defence game with a bit Role-Play mechanics very unique styled tower defence that allows the player to get more interactive with the game instead of being a  place and wait game. it was released as a mobile game then later was released as a pc game including Linux support and even moving to Playstation 3.Controls on controller was a learning curve but not as bad as other ports the game was multiplayer online and local which made it a great couch game with friends and family in 2011 it was released on steam with free downloadable content and giving the player the open-source code to everything that would allow modifications.

--The game was developed by a studio name Trendy Entertainment (aka.Chromatic Games) in 2010 they started up the studio 2009 took a year of development to get the game out and they were very successful for a small indie game developer they sold 250,000k units in just the first week of launch and by the end of the year they were at 600,000k and they released it in october and by february 2012 they were already in the millions they game took off pretty quickly they updated the game fairly often crushing in bugs that came up with the help of player feed back they added micro-transations for costumes and Visual effects and even a few extra classes that were very nice and affordable and not locking players out of content.

--it was created in Unreal Engine 3 game a pretty well optimized but didn't have a limit on what spawns in the area so if you have to many defence and to many monster the game start to lag. They start with four classes you can choose from also known as heros Apprentice, Huntress, monk, and squire as well as a few DLC you start in a small room and the tutorial is very well spoken and easy to follow its also skippable if your already an experienced player each class has their own tower defences to place there's no limits on how many you can place unless using special towers its set in a fantasy world cartoon graphics but still 3D. well balanced not easy but not to extremely hard even on Easy mode still make you thaink before acting.

## Final Thoughts

Overall This game is fantastic it combines RPG and tower defence and multiplayer for your friends with a massive difficulty range from easy to extreme always allowing a challenge has a great upgrade system and very balanced. The few things i would change to make this game better for my personal taste is the music its kinda lack luster for me but that a matter of opinion doesn't affect overall gameplay another major feature is you player as an actual actor not just a camera the player can actually fight with their own ability and spells and aid their towers. Don't have any other issues with the game other then music
