## Summary

--dying light is a zombie game that takes place in huran a Qurenteeined city that takes the open-world style into a whole new perspective by adding a very advanced parkour mechanics to the game that has never been seen before making this game stand out from every other game the game starts with a new article giving small background to the outbreak and how it happens and the current state of the situation

--you start as an agent for a government that wants the player to recover classified documents that someone on the inside of the city that has the "cure" for the virus and someone is holding it hostage they drop you in via plane parachuting into the city and the player getting caught up with the enemy but then getting rescued by some refugees where you being the tutorial of the game 

--The tutorials to this game are fantastic and teaches you really well on how the parkour aspect work since it hasn't been done before and even the controls on the controller are very weird compared to what everyone is using to even mouse and keyboard is slightly different than the average game forcing everyone to learn a new game style 

--the game was reacted by a company called techLand the developer of another zombie game called deadisland a less favorited game but was the start of dying light dead island was a spoofing game while dying light was a serious take on it.their was  no game-breaking bugs, but there were a few exploits that allow easy cheating but other than that the game players perfect from beginning to end a few years later the released an expansion to the game that added a whole new world and continued the story that followed up to their sequal even the expansion adding tons of more hours of content felts like another game entirely.

## Final Thoughts
--I highly recommned this game to anyone looking for a new experice in a intense zombie parkour game that feel like something new the music in this game is really great it has great multiplayer aspect allowing up to 4 players to contriune the story together as well as do fun compititions to compete with one or another and even share things that someone else doesnt have ovrall this game is really well devolped.
