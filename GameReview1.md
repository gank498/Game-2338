## Summary
  This Game is a game that Has RPG mechanics but is also board game up to 4 player co-op or single player vs computer player.
The game is competitive but also requires player to work together make the strategy much more unique the art style is very solid even has a good amount of different animations very minimum character creation but enough to tell each player apart and the Job system is very good but limited you start with a choice of 3 jobs and you can switch between anytime as well has expandable jobs that can be unlocked via mastering jobs.

  The game also has an economy system with random event's that can cause a market to crash as well as players who decided to go evil. Their battle system is basic Rock paper scissors with a 4th option for special ability that each class has. The game can be repetitive at times but the random events keep it changing most of the time keeping the game fresh. Sounds and music wise are pretty solid music is great but the music for the board game part does get old fast maybe if there was a few different songs on shuffle for the over world the characters do have voices and are fantastic each job has their own catch phrases that are randomized the game was written in Japanese as native so translations are easy but the make up with it when new enemies pronounce there names in voice help with the language curve.

  The game was devolved by a company called Sting Entertainment a relatively small company that started in Japan that are known for their JRPG games but not as popular in the U. S they make all their console game in OverRide their own made engine base of Unreal engine 3. They are a team of 33 that started their studio in 1989 and published there first game in 1990 called Psycho Chaser a top down shooter arcade game that sold well a year later Sony Entertainment japan had them publish a baseball game in japan on the Super Nintendo entertainment system called Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League a.k.a. Extra Innings."Extra Innings's controls were unlike many of the era, featuring pitches with vertical break, diving and sliding catches that could be assisted by the AI, and independent runner control"
  
## Final Thoughts
   I Believe this game is really great and its back by a company that has had great idea's and unique things in their old games so this game has a lot of unique things that make it different from games of it era and still yet to see any other game like it's truly a one of a kind game. But is far from perfect there are a lot of small issues like the ability for any class to use any weapons making class specific weapons kinda useless. Also, the when using physical attacks if its high enough you can't counter it and pretty much make's it a one button to win the whole game. Other than that no bugs or exploits even save states in emulators can't change the outcome of the randomizer
