## Summary
This Game is a game that Has RPG mechanics but is also board game up to 4 player co-op or single player vs computer player.
The game is competitive but also requires player to work together make the strategy much more unique the art style is very solid even has a good amount of different animations very minium character creation but enough to tell each player apart and the Job system is very good but limited you start with a choice of 3 jobs and you can switch between anytime as well has expandable jobs that can be unlocked via mastering jobs.
  The game also has a economy system with random event's that can cause a market to crash as well as players who decied to go evil. The battle system is basic Rock paper scissors with a 4th option for special ability that each class has
