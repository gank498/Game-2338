Summary

Final Thoughts
in 2016 I would have advised not to buy it find something else but in 2020 I recommend checking it out it's still getting loads of updates and content and a growing community it's a great game to kill time has a great soundtrack i would like to see more than just your 4 companions in the universe but other than that the game environment does feel alive and draws you into exploring
