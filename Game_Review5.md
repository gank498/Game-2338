## Summary

Castle crasher is a side-scrolling 4 player local co-op hack and slash game that came out in 2008 on the Xbox 360 as old as this game is it is still being re-released on current-gen consoles like the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 but why? so I picked up this game on the switch after playing it on steam a few years back and jumping in I can already see visual enhancements and UI changes that look and feel great compared to the original it's simple and straight to the point with its whacky and funny comments on each setting.
--The game start out with a choice of multiple colors of choice and each color of character represents the type of magic you will learn you start out with four but able to unlock up to 32 playable colors/Characters that a pretty big upgrade you unlock these via DLC or in-game events once you and or your friends choose your color it just throws you in the story but the very first stage has optional tutorials that are easy to understand and are skippable if you have played before which is nice for veteran players who don't want to deal with pesky tutorials that you have to do every time you play a new game.
 --the controls are simple and every time you unlock something it will tell you how to perform the unlocked ability fighting gets more fun with more combos you unlock there is a Level up system that allows you to put stat point which allows verity of playstyles which is nice and you can even swap out characters any time to a different color if you don't like the one you have but will require you to start at level 1 but able to continue story with your friends without starting story progression over.
 --the game was developed by "The Behemoth" his name is John Baez and he had a team of 2 other people who also developed a game called BattleBlock Theater very popular in 2013 most of their work was flash games in newground.com where he gained popularity with the signature logo of a big chicken. the inspiration for this game came from old fighting games like Double Dragon and River City Ransom which were big games in their times. they wanted to recreate that game style in modern-day.

## Final Thoughts

The game is very challenging not for casule players but its extreamly fun reguardless music is great the way the introduce new mecanics are very well done it's very wacky at time making the game funny and even pits you agest your team mates sometimes.its a great couch game to play with some friends I would like to see a few more modes added it only has story and player vs player overall i recommend this game to anyone who likes player local multiplayer together.
